GPS devices are expensive. I've never really understood the appeal of carrying a small battery powered device that can pinpoint my location
to within 10 - 15 meters. That's not to say that I've never been in need of one, often when at the top of a hill, in a valley or just meandering
in cloud desperate for a point of reference I'd have gladly taken it's advice.

More often than not when I'm out on the hills I have with me an OS map of the area combined with a rough approximation of the route we're going to take.
This may change based on tireness levels, sudden realisation of the steepness/distance/bogginess of the route we've picked or the proximity to a
reasonable pub with a varied selection of refreshements. But most of the time I'm fairly confident in identifying my location using the map, a compass and
my surroundings.

A few days ago whilst up near Glenridding we discovered a group of Young Farmers walking the coast to coast. They'd stumbled off the path in a particularly
rough rain storm. With zero visibility and no point of reference their water logged map and compass combo only served to give them a direction in
which to walk. What wouldv'e been useful would be something extra to refer to so that they could confirm their location.


## Surely my phone does that?
Yes my iPhone does have a GPS chip built in. It does also have a connection to the outside world through the internet and I can download maps onto it. However
it's expensive, not 100% waterproof and has limited battery life. (Also whilst out and about it rarely has enough of a data connection to serve a purpose). A
